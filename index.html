        <p> Oakwood was founded in 1998 as the Morgan Hill Country School. Michelle Riches Helvey and her husband Ted Helvey purchased the school and reestablished the school as Oakwood School. In 2005, the high school grades began and in 2009, Oakwood graduated its first senior class.

Oakwood is the sister school of Pinewood School, Los Altos, which was founded by Gwen Riches (mother of Michelle Riches Helvey), in 1959.</p>

      Oakwood offers a large number of AP classes. The overwhelming majority of students take one or more AP classes a year (with the exception of freshmen). Such classes include AP Art (2D and 3D), AP Spanish, AP French, AP Environmental Science, AP Physics, AP Chemistry, AP Government, AP European History, and AP US History. These classes often qualify students for college credits at the college level.</section>
